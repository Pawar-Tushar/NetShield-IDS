## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pawar-Tushar/NetShield-IDS.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd NetShield-IDS
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies using pip**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python Main.py  
    ```
---

## Usage Examples

1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   
- **Set a password**: If it's your first time, you'll be prompted to set a new password.
- **Login**: Enter the password to access the system.
- **Start monitoring**: The application will start sniffing network traffic to detect any potential attacks.
---

## Security Considerations

- Ensure the `password_hash.txt` file is properly secured to prevent unauthorized access.
- Regularly update the attack detection patterns and thresholds in the `signature_rules.json` file to address new types of threats.
- Avoid running the system with elevated privileges unless absolutely necessary.
---

## Troubleshooting

- **If the application fails to start:** Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly. Use `pip list` to check the installed packages.
- **If the network interface is not recognized:** Ensure your network interface is active and properly configured for sniffing.
- **Incorrect password issues:** If you forget the password, delete the `password_hash.txt` file and reconfigure it by setting a new password.
